# Superfast TodoMVC Example

This is a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) example for [Superfast](http://ghub.io/superfast) and [Temple](http://ghub.io/templejs).

To run locally, you will need the Superfast CLI tool installed, as well as local node modules installed. Then just run the Superfast command in the directory to start a local server. The app will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.

```bash
$ npm i superfast -g
$ npm i
$ superfast init
$ superfast
```
